#### Custom plot of *ASS1* epigenetic data using D3.JS

by Combiz Khozoie, Ph.D.

UCSC Genome Track data for an epigenetic marker (H3K27Ac) associated with the promoter regions of active genes was obtained and saved as a CSV.  The data is plotted for a region proximal to a gene of interest (*ASS1*) for seven different cell types and includes annotation of four regions which were selected for further analysis using ChIP-qPCR (purple).  This plot was  exported into a vector-editor to integrate into a figure for publication.
